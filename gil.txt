GIL : Global Interpreter Lock
- A lock that allows only one thread at a time to execute in python

- needed in CPython because memory management is not thread-safe

- Avoid:
    - use multiprocessing
    - use a different, free-threaded python implementation (Jython, IronPython)
    - use a python as a wrapper for a third-party libraries (C/C++) -> numpy, scipy
