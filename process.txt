Process: An instance of a computer program that is being executed by one or many threads. It contains the program code and its activity. (e.g apython interpreter)

+ takes advantages of multiple CPUs and cores
+ seperate memory space -> memory is not shared between processes
+ great for CPU-bound processing
+ new process is started idependently from other processes
+ processes are interruptable/killable
+ one GIL for each process -> avoids GIL limitation

- Heavyweight
- starting a process is slower than starting a thread.
- more memory
- IPC (inter-process communication) is more complicated
