Thread : An entity within a process that can be scheduled (also known as "leightweight process")
A process can spawn multiple threads.

+ All threads within a process share the same memory
+ leightweight
+ starting a thread is faster than starting a process
+ great for I/O-bound tasks

- threading is limited by GIL : Only one thread at a time
- no effect for CPU-bound tasks
- not interruptable/killable
- careful with race conditions (as when 2 or more threads modifies same variable can cause bugs and crashes)
